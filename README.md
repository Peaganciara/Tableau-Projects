### 1. Opioid Crisis
A deep dive into the correlation between Medicaid reimbursement and the opioid crisis. This project takes into cosideration the prescribing rate of individual doctors, zipcodes and states, deaths caused by opioid overdose and the Medicaid reimbursement amount to each state for opioids. Once all factors were compared, the most relevant connection to opioid related deaths seems to be medicaid reimbursement. The data provided has limitations and the findings are relative to the sample size received in the data spreadsheet.
